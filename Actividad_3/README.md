# How to use Script

### report
the report for this activity is located within this directory and contains the full name listed in canvas for ease

### setup
The script is expecting a dataset located in 
```
Spotify/data.csv
```
of its local directory

If you wish to change the dataset simply remove the current data.csv file and add your own renaming it data.csv if necessary.

### running the code
once the data.csv file is located in the correct directory ensure your terminal is located inside the Actividad_2 folder and run the following command to start the script

```
python3 Script.py
```

### TIPS
if you change the dataset ensure you also change the variables inside the code as the script is expecting to access specific variables that might not exist.
